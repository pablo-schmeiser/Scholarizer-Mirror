However, thermal issues arising out of higher power densities have limited their widespread use. While prior works have looked at reducing dynamic power through reduced memory accesses, in these memories, both leakage and dynamic power consumption are comparable. Furthermore, as the temperature rises the leakage power increases, creating a thermal-leakage loop. We study the impact of leakage power on 3D memory temperature and propose turning OFF hot channels to meet thermal constraints. Data is migrated to a 2D memory before closing a 3D channel. We introduce an analytical model to assess the 2D memory delay and use the model to guide data migration decisions. Our experiments show that the proposed optimization improves performance by 27% on an average (up to 66%) over state-of-the-art strategies.\",\n        \"authors\": \"Lokesh Siddhu,P.

However, due to the Thermal Design Power (TDP) constraint, it is not possible to continuously operate all cores at the same time. Exceeding the TDP constraint may activate the Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) to ensure thermal stability. Such hardware based closed-loop safeguards pose a big challenge in using many-core chips for real-time tasks. Managing the worst-case peak power usage of a chip can help toward resolving this issue. We present a scheme to minimize the peak power usage for frame-based and periodic real-time tasks on many-core processors by scheduling the sleep cycles for each active core and introduce the concept of a sufficient test for peak power consumption for task feasibility. We consider both inter-task and inter-core diversity in terms of power usage and present computationally efficient algorithms for peak power minimization for these cases, i.e., a special case of “homogeneous tasks on homogeneous cores” to the general case of “heterogeneous tasks on heterogeneous cores”. We evaluate our solution through extensive simulations using the 48-core SCC platform and gem5 architecture simulator. Our simulation results show the efficacy of our scheme.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2014-12-01\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"3b932f41bcef0726397f9100e706587a51e05ed8\",\r\n            \"citations\": 89,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"J.

We therefore propose to use Thermal Safe Power (TSP) as a more efficient power budget.

Hence, modern many-core processors require sophisticated thermal and resource management strategies to mitigate these undesirable side effects. A simulation-based evaluation of these strategies is limited by the accuracy of the underlying processor model and the simulation speed. Therefore, we present, for the first time, an field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based evaluation approach to test and compare thermal and resource management strategies using the combination of benchmark generation, FPGA-based application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) emulation, and run-time monitoring. The proposed benchmark generation method enables an evaluation of run-time management strategies for applications with various run-time characteristics. Furthermore, the ASIC emulation platform features a novel distributed temperature emulator design, whose overhead scales linearly with the number of integrated cores, and a novel dynamic voltage frequency scaling emulator design, which precisely models the timing and energy overhead of voltage and frequency transitions. In our evaluations, we demonstrate the proposed approach for a tiled many-core processor with 80 cores on four Virtex-7 FPGAs.

For instance, the competition for last-level cache by concurrently-running applications may lead to slowing down the execution and to potentially violating individual performance constraints. Clustered many-cores reduce cache contention at chip level by sharing caches only at cluster level. To reduce cache con-tention within a cluster, state-of-the art techniques aim to co-map a memory-intensive application with a compute-intensive application onto one cluster. However, compute-intensive applications typ-ically consume high power, and therefore, executing another application in their nearby cores may lead to high temperatures. Hence, there is a trade-off between cache contention and temperature. This paper is the first to consider this trade-off through a novel thermal- and cache-aware resource management technique. We build a neural network (NN)-based model to predict the slowdown of the application execution induced by cache contention feeding our resource management technique that then optimizes the application mapping and selects the voltage/frequency levels of the clus-ters to compensate for the potential contention-induced slowdown. Thereby, it meets the performance constraints, while minimizing temperature.

A multicore processor can be exploited by executing multiple applications simultaneously on the chip. Furthermore, multiple threads of each application can be also executed in parallel on multiple cores. To optimize for performance in multicores, it is necessary to employ resource management techniques that manage the resources of the chip considering the running applications. Specifically, resource management can allocate more cores to applications to exploit their parallelism and upscale the voltage and frequency levels (V/f levels) of the cores to increase their speeds. While such potential decisions of resource management improve the performance, they may, unfortunately, elevate the on-chip temperatures, which have negative impacts on reliability. One of the major temperature-dependent reliability concerns is the circuit aging. In particular, aging leads to an increase in the threshold voltage, which, in turn, may increase the delay of the processor’s paths and eventually induce timing errors. Due to the adverse impacts of temperature and aging on reliability, they have been considered as dire design constraints. Therefore, this dissertation focuses on the relevant problem of performance optimization under temperature and aging constraints. To achieve this goal, several resource management techniques are introduced in this dissertation to maximize the overall system performance, while satisfying temperature and aging constraints within the decision making process. Firstly, temperature-constrained resource management techniques are proposed for homogenous and heterogeneous multicores. These techniques allocate cores to multithreaded applications, indicating the number of parallel threads of each application, and determine the V/f level of the cores that execute each application. These decisions are conducted while taking into account the Thread Level Parallelism (TLP) and the Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) of the applications, aiming at maximizing the overall system performance under a temperature constraint. Moreover, the positioning of inactive (power-gated) cores throughout the chip is selected such that they facilitate dissipating the generated heat from active cores. That, in turn, reduces the temperature of active cores and allows upscaling their V/f levels leading to further performance improvement. Afterwards, an aging-constrained resource management technique is introduced with the goal of maximizing the overall system performance under an aging constraint. Towards achieving this goal, an aging-aware design space is explored, which translates temperature and voltage into the resulting amount of aging quantified as an increase\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"745a183826d117abbd992926fb08e10d9d0fbb0e\",\r\n            \"citations\": 0,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"1739035105\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Marcel Mettler\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"81650122\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Martin Rapp\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"1397424763\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Daniel Mueller-Gritschneder\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"J.

The standby-sparing technique can improve system reliability while it might increase the temperature of the system beyond safe limits. In this paper, we propose a thermal-aware standby-sparing (TASS) technique that aims at maximizing the Quality of Service (QoS) of soft real-time tasks, which is defined as a function of the finishing time of running tasks. The proposed technique tolerates permanent and transient faults for multicore real-time embedded systems while meeting the Thermal Safe Power (TSP) as the core-level power constraint, which avoids thermal emergencies in on-chip systems. Executing the main and backup tasks on the cores at any power consumption below TSP guarantees that no thermal violation occurs. Our TASS proposed method provides an opportunity to remove the overlaps of the execution of main and backup tasks to prevent extra power consumption due to applying the fault-tolerant technique. Meanwhile, in order to maximize the QoS, we employ a heterogeneous platform to execute the main tasks as soon as possible on high-performance cores with more power budget. The backup tasks are executed on low power cores after finishing the main tasks. In this case, when the main task finishes successfully, the whole of its corresponding backup task can be dropped, resulting in a significant amount of power and temperature reduction. Therefore, in the fault-free scenarios, the spare cores can be powered down, and only the main tasks are scheduled and executed on the primary cores. Experiments show that our proposed method improves QoS up to 39.78% (on average by 18.40%) and reduces the peak power consumption and temperature by up to 40.21% and 15.47˚C (on average 28.31% and 13.60˚C), respectively, at runtime, while keeping the system reliability at the required level.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2022-10-01\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"d22528c248a10bb6fdafb72c7f9b1ada9f0ed8fc\",\r\n            \"citations\": 38,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"3265937\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"T.

To this end, Hybrid Application Mapping (HAM) methodologies combine design-time analysis with runtime mapping techniques to enable dynamic application mapping with performance guarantees, e.g., w.r.t. real-time constraints. They rely on composability to derive the required performance guarantees in an isolated analysis of individual applications at design time. The ongoing process technology downsizing, however, has given rise to an increased on-chip temperature, so that the thermal integrity of the platform must be monitored and enforced at run time by means of Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) techniques which use countermeasures e.g. DVFS and power gating. This, however, violates composability, as the thermally unsafe behavior of one application may trigger DTM countermeasures that affect other applications running in the thermally affected region which, in turn, may lead to the violation of their real-time constraints. As a remedy, this paper proposes, for the first time, a thermally composable HAM methodology that enforces thermal safety proactively at the launch time of applications and, thereby, prevents DTM interferences which react to thermal violations. To that end, we present (a) a novel thermal-safety analysis that can be integrated into the design-time analysis of HAM and (b) a set of thermal-safety admission checks that can be used at run time when launching an application. By establishing thermal composability among running applications, the proposed HAM approach enables providing thermally safe real-time guarantees for dynamically mapped applications in many-core systems.

In particular, technology scaling increases the processor susceptibility to radiation-induced transient faults. Moreover, technology scaling with the discontinuation of Dennard scaling increases the power densities, thereby temperatures, on the chip. High temperature, in turn, accelerates transistor aging mechanisms, which may ultimately lead to permanent faults on the chip. To assure a reliable system operation, despite these potential reliability concerns, fault-tolerance techniques have emerged. Specifically, fault-tolerance techniques employ some kind of redundancies to satisfy specific reliability requirements. However, the integration of fault-tolerance techniques into real-time embedded systems complicates preserving timing constraints. As a remedy, many task mapping/scheduling policies have been proposed to consider the integration of fault-tolerance techniques and enforce both timing and reliability guarantees for real-time embedded systems. More advanced techniques aim additionally at minimizing power and energy while at the same time satisfying timing and reliability constraints. Recently, some scheduling techniques have started to tackle a new challenge, which is the temperature increase induced by employing fault-tolerance techniques. These emerging techniques aim at satisfying temperature constraints besides timing and reliability constraints. This paper provides an in-depth survey of the emerging research efforts that exploit fault-tolerance techniques while considering timing, power/energy, and temperature from the real-time embedded systems’ design perspective. In particular, the task mapping/scheduling policies for faulttolerance real-time embedded systems are reviewed and classified according to their considered goals and constraints. Moreover, the employed fault-tolerance techniques, application models, and hardware models are considered as additional dimensions of the presented classification.

However, the huge design space of possible task mappings, the unpredictable workload dynamism, and the numerous non-functional requirements of applications in terms of timing, reliability, safety, and so forth. impose significant challenges when designing many-core systems. Hybrid Application Mapping (HAM) is an emerging class of design methodologies for many-core systems which address these challenges via an incremental (per-application) mapping scheme: The mapping process is divided into (i) a design-time Design Space Exploration (DSE) step per application to obtain a set of high-quality mapping options and (ii) a run-time system management step in which applications are launched dynamically (on demand) using the precomputed mappings. This paper provides an overview of HAM and the design methodologies developed in line with it. We introduce the basics of HAM and elaborate on the way it addresses the major challenges of application mapping in many-core systems. We provide an overview of the main challenges encountered when employing HAM and survey a collection of state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies proposed to address these challenges. We finally present an overview of open topics and challenges in HAM, provide a summary of emerging trends for addressing them particularly using machine learning, and outline possible future directions. While there exists a large body of HAM methodologies, the techniques studied in this paper are developed, to a large extent, within the scope of invasive computing. Invasive computing introduces resource awareness into applications and employs explicit resource reservation to enable incremental application mapping and dynamic system management.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2020-11-17\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9268/10/4/38/pdf?version=1605603039\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"c4fc3cddd12063611b9a9ed4ec4ba8ddbf14b51f\",\r\n            \"citations\": 0,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"153631156\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Mohsen Ansari\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2144694858\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Sepideh Safari\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2022561502\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Pourya Gohari-Nazari\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"J.

Checkpointing with rollback-recovery is a well-established technique to tolerate transient faults in multicore platforms. To consider the worst-case fault occurrence scenario, checkpointing technique requires to re-execute some parts of the tasks, and that might lead to simultaneous execution of task parts with high power consumptions, which eventually might result in a peak power increase beyond the thermal design power (TDP). Exceeding TDP can elevate on-chip temperatures beyond safe limits, and thereby triggering countermeasures that throttle down the voltage and frequency levels or power gate the cores. Such countermeasures might lead to violating task deadlines and degrading the system's reliability. To avoid such severe scenarios, it is inevitable to consider the impact of applying fault-tolerant techniques on the power consumption and prevent violating the power constraint of the chip, i.e., TDP. This article presents for the first time, a peak-power-aware checkpointing (PPAC) technique that tolerates a given number of faults, k, while at the same time meets the power constraint in hard real-time embedded systems. To do this, our proposed technique (PPAC) adjusts the timing of the checkpoints, which have lower power consumption than the tasks to the execution time points that have power spikes beyond TDP. Moreover, PPAC exploits the available slack times on the cores to delay the execution of some tasks to avoid the remaining power spikes beyond TDP, which could not be mitigated by solely adjusting checkpoints. To evaluate our technique, we extend the state-of-the-art system-level simulator, gem5, with the state-of-the-art checkpointing module in Linux. Our experimental results show that our proposed technique is able to tolerate a given number of faults without exceeding the timing and power constraints in hard real-time embedded systems. The resulting peak power reduction achieved by our technique compared to state-of-the-art techniques is an average of 23%. Moreover, our technique employs the Dynamic Power Management (DPM) during the slack times resulting at runtime in the case of fault-free scenarios, which provides energy savings with an average of 17.28% and up to 61.1%.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2022-12-01\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"e5f15f4132803a52b8cc4b2b247e1a004f59ccbf\",\r\n            \"citations\": 53,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"1970668\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Santiago Pagani\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"1740748\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"É.

For such architectures, we present a resource management technique that introduces power density as a novel system level constraint, in order to avoid thermal violations. The proposed technique then assigns applications to tiles by choosing their degree of parallelism and the voltage/frequency levels of each tile, such that the power density constraint is satisfied.

This mandates careful rationing of the power budget amongst the tasks for full exploitation of the many-core. Past research proposed power budgeting techniques that redistribute power budget amongst tasks based on up-to-date information about their current phases. This phase information needs to be constantly propagated throughout the system and processed, inhibiting scalability. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic technique for power budgeting which requires no exchange of phase information yet provides mathematical guarantees on judicial use of the TDP.

However, using a single and constant value as power constraint, e.g., TDP, can result in significant performance losses in homogeneous and heterogeneous manycore systems. Having better power budgeting techniques is a major step towards dealing with the dark silicon problem. This paper presents a new power budget concept, called Thermal Safe Power (TSP), which is an abstraction that provides safe power and power density constraints as a function of the number of simultaneously active cores. Executing cores at any power consumption below TSP ensures that DTM is not triggered. TSP can be computed offline for the worst cases, or online for a particular mapping of cores. TSP can also serve as a fundamental tool for guiding task partitioning and core mapping decisions, specially when core heterogeneity or timing guarantees are involved.

This paper demonstrates that this leads to suboptimal boosting decisions because the sensitivities of power and temperature also play a profound impact and need to be included within the optimization. Therefore, we introduce a novel boosting metric that integrates all relevant metrics: the application-dependent V/f sensitivities of performance and power, and the core-dependent sensitivity of the temperature. This new boosting metric is derived at run-time using machine learning via a neural network (NN) model, which accurately estimates the V/f sensitivities of performance and power of a priori unknown applications with diverse and time-varying characteristics. This new metric enables to build a smart, yet lightweight, boosting technique to maximize the performance under a temperature constraint. The experimental results demonstrate a 21 % average improvement of the system performance over the state-of-the-art at a negligible run-time overhead of 0.8 %.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2021-12-05\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"fb9b8d2357344cea46b78115bd7bd06a00405380\",\r\n            \"citations\": 15,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"J.

For instance, Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) leads to an increase in the threshold voltage of a transistor. That, in turn, may prolong the critical path delay of the processor and eventually may lead to timing errors. In order to avoid aging-induced timing errors, designers employ guardbands either with respect to voltage or frequency. State-of-the-art techniques determine a guardband type at the circuit level at design time irrespective from the running workload at the system level. Our investigation revealed that generated temperatures by a running workload have the potential to play a key role in determining the appropriate guardband type with respect to system performance. Therefore, we propose a paradigm shift in designing guardbands: to select the guardband types on-the-fly with respect to the workload-induced temperatures aiming at optimizing for performance under temperature and reliability constraints. Moreover, different guardband types for different cores can be selected simultaneously when multiple applications with diverse properties suggest this to be useful. Our dynamic guardband selection allows for a higher performance compared to techniques that employ a fixed (at design time) guardband type throughout.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"d368fed35cfc6489dcdc22f15f998faa3320667d\",\r\n            \"citations\": 0,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"81650122\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Martin Rapp\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2165805657\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Nikita Krohmer\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"J.

However, selecting the core to execute each application and the voltage/frequency (V/f) levels of each cluster is a complex problem because 1) the diverse characteristics and QoS targets of applications require different optimizations, and 2) per-cluster DVFS requires a global optimization considering all running applications. State-of-the-art resource management techniques for power or temperature minimization either rely on measurements that are often not available (such as power) or fail to consider all the dimensions of the problem (e.g., by using simplified analytical models). Imitation learning (IL) enables to use the optimality of an oracle policy, yet at low run-time overhead, by training a model from oracle demonstrations. We are the first to employ IL for temperature minimization under QoS targets. We tackle the complexity by training a neural network (NN) and accelerate the NN inference using a neural processing unit (NPU).

Accurately forecasting future power changes is highly relevant for proactive power/thermal management. While forecasting power is straightforward for known or periodic workloads, the challenge for general unknown workloads at different voltage/frequency (v/n-levels is still unsolved. Our technique is based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) to forecast the average power consumption for both the next 1ms and 10ms periods. The runtime inputs for the LSTM RNN are current and past power information as well as performance counter readings. An LSTM RNN enables this forecasting due to its ability to preserve the history of power and performance counters. Our LSTM RNN needs to be trained only once at design-time while adapting during run-time to different system behavior through its internal memory. We demonstrate that our approach accurately forecasts power for unseen applications at different v/f-levels. The experimental results shows that the forecasts of our LSTM RNN provide 43% lower worst case error for the 1ms forecasts and 38% for the 10ms forecasts. comnared to the state of the art.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2021-02-01\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"fd363aabb9b04ccc1279ffbf7f87eee41a3dac37\",\r\n            \"citations\": 7,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2144694858\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Sepideh Safari\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2022561502\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Pourya Gohari-Nazari\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"153631156\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Mohsen Ansari\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"1784633\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"S.

The availability of multiple cores on a single chip provides opportunities to employ fault-tolerant techniques, to ensure the reliability of MCSs. However, applying fault-tolerant techniques increases the power consumption on the chip, and thereby, on-chip temperatures might increase beyond safe limits. To prevent thermal emergencies, urgent countermeasures, like DVFS or DPM will be triggered to cool down the chip. Such countermeasures, however, might not only lead to suspending low-criticality tasks, but also might lead to violating timing constraints of high-criticality tasks. Therefore, it is indispensable to consider a temperature constraint within the scheduling process of fault-tolerant MCSs. Therefore, this paper presents, for the first time, a thermal-aware scheduling scheme for fault-tolerant MCSs, named TherMa-MiCs, which satisfies the temperature constraint jointly with the timing constraints of the high-criticality tasks, while attempting to maximize the QoS of low-criticality tasks under the predefined constraints. At the same time, a reliability target is satisfied by employing the well-known N-Modular Redundancy fault-tolerant technique.

In particular, technology scaling increases the processor susceptibility to radiation-induced transient faults. Moreover, technology scaling with the discontinuation of Dennard scaling increases the power densities, thereby temperatures, on the chip. High temperature, in turn, accelerates transistor aging mechanisms, which may ultimately lead to permanent faults on the chip. To assure a reliable system operation, despite these potential reliability concerns, fault-tolerance techniques have emerged. Specifically, fault-tolerance techniques employ some kind of redundancies to satisfy specific reliability requirements. However, the integration of fault-tolerance techniques into real-time embedded systems complicates preserving timing constraints. As a remedy, many task mapping/scheduling policies have been proposed to consider the integration of fault-tolerance techniques and enforce both timing and reliability guarantees for real-time embedded systems. More advanced techniques aim additionally at minimizing power and energy while at the same time satisfying timing and reliability constraints. Recently, some scheduling techniques have started to tackle a new challenge, which is the temperature increase induced by employing fault-tolerance techniques. These emerging techniques aim at satisfying temperature constraints besides timing and reliability constraints. This paper provides an in-depth survey of the emerging research efforts that exploit fault-tolerance techniques while considering timing, power/energy, and temperature from the real-time embedded systems’ design perspective. In particular, the task mapping/scheduling policies for fault-tolerance real-time embedded systems are reviewed and classified according to their considered goals and constraints. Moreover, the employed fault-tolerance techniques, application models, and hardware models are considered as additional dimensions of the presented classification.

The cooling solution is designed to dissipate this power level. But because TDP is not necessarily the maximum power that can be applied, chips are operated with Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) techniques. To avoid excessive triggers of DTM, usually, system designers also use TDP as power constraint. However, using a single and constant value as power constraint, e.g., TDP, can result in big performance losses in many-core systems. Having better power budgeting techniques is a major step towards dealing with the dark silicon problem. This paper presents a new power budget concept, called Thermal Safe Power (TSP), which is an abstraction that provides safe power constraint values as a function of the number of simultaneously operating cores. Executing cores at any power consumption below TSP ensures that DTM is not triggered. TSP can be computed offline for the worst cases, or online for a particular mapping of cores. Our simulations show that using TSP as power constraint results in 50.5% and 14.2% higher average performance, compared to using constant power budgets (both per-chip and per-core) and a boosting technique, respectively. Moreover, TSP results in dark silicon estimations which are more optimistic than estimations using constant power budgets.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2014-10-12\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2656075.2656103\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"a141c558a7add5ecae33b38003eb34516b95393f\",\r\n            \"citations\": 17,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"1970668\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Santiago Pagani\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"145063983\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"M.

Hence, a resource management technique, that allocates cores to application aiming at maximizing the system performance, will not be able to achieve its goal without taking into account the on-chip temperature and its impact on the availability of the chip's resources. However, considering a temperature constraint by the resource management will further increase its complexity, especially in manycores, and thus implementing it in a centralized scheme might lead to a computation bottleneck and a single point of failure. To avoid such scenarios, it is inevitable to distribute the computation required by the resource management technique throughout the chip. In this article, we propose a distributed resource management technique that considers temperature as an essential factor in allocating cores to applications and determining the power states of these cores and their voltage/frequency levels, while taking into account the performance models of the applications in order to maximize the overall system performance under a temperature constraint. Our proposed technique employs, for the first time, combinatorial auctions within an agent system to achieve the targeted goal in a distributed manner.

Accordingly, Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) allows the many-core to deliver precise amount of processing required to meet the task QoS guarantee while conserving power. Still, a global control is necessitated to ensure that the many-core overall does not exceed its power budget.Previously, only non-stochastic controls have been proposed for the problem of QoS-aware power budgeting in many-cores. We propose the first stochastic control for the problem, which has a computational complexity less than the non-stochastic control by a factor of O (ln n) but with equivalent performance.

Such hardware based closed-loop safeguards pose a big challenge in using many-core chips for real-time tasks. Managing the worst-case peak power usage of a chip can help toward resolving this issue. We present a scheme to minimize the peak power usage for frame-based and periodic real-time tasks on many-core processors by scheduling the sleep cycles for each active core and introduce the concept of a sufficient test for peak power consumption for task feasibility. We consider both inter-task and inter-core diversity in terms of power usage and present computationally efficient algorithms for peak power minimization for these cases, i.e., a special case of “homogeneous tasks on homogeneous cores” to the general case of “heterogeneous tasks on heterogeneous cores”. We evaluate our solution through extensive simulations using the 48-core SCC platform and gem5 architecture simulator.

For instance, the competition for last-level cache by concurrently-running applications may lead to slowing down the execution and to potentially violating individual performance constraints. Clustered many-cores reduce cache contention at chip level by sharing caches only at cluster level. To reduce cache con-tention within a cluster, state-of-the art techniques aim to co-map a memory-intensive application with a compute-intensive application onto one cluster. However, compute-intensive applications typ-ically consume high power, and therefore, executing another application in their nearby cores may lead to high temperatures. Hence, there is a trade-off between cache contention and temperature. This paper is the first to consider this trade-off through a novel thermal- and cache-aware resource management technique. We build a neural network (NN)-based model to predict the slowdown of the application execution induced by cache contention feeding our resource management technique that then optimizes the application mapping and selects the voltage/frequency levels of the clus-ters to compensate for the potential contention-induced slowdown. Thereby, it meets the performance constraints, while minimizing temperature.

A multicore processor can be exploited by executing multiple applications simultaneously on the chip. Furthermore, multiple threads of each application can be also executed in parallel on multiple cores. To optimize for performance in multicores, it is necessary to employ resource management techniques that manage the resources of the chip considering the running applications. Specifically, resource management can allocate more cores to applications to exploit their parallelism and upscale the voltage and frequency levels (V/f levels) of the cores to increase their speeds. While such potential decisions of resource management improve the performance, they may, unfortunately, elevate the on-chip temperatures, which have negative impacts on reliability. One of the major temperature-dependent reliability concerns is the circuit aging. In particular, aging leads to an increase in the threshold voltage, which, in turn, may increase the delay of the processor’s paths and eventually induce timing errors. Due to the adverse impacts of temperature and aging on reliability, they have been considered as dire design constraints. Therefore, this dissertation focuses on the relevant problem of performance optimization under temperature and aging constraints. To achieve this goal, several resource management techniques are introduced in this dissertation to maximize the overall system performance, while satisfying temperature and aging constraints within the decision making process. Firstly, temperature-constrained resource management techniques are proposed for homogenous and heterogeneous multicores. These techniques allocate cores to multithreaded applications, indicating the number of parallel threads of each application, and determine the V/f level of the cores that execute each application. These decisions are conducted while taking into account the Thread Level Parallelism (TLP) and the Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) of the applications, aiming at maximizing the overall system performance under a temperature constraint. Moreover, the positioning of inactive (power-gated) cores throughout the chip is selected such that they facilitate dissipating the generated heat from active cores. That, in turn, reduces the temperature of active cores and allows upscaling their V/f levels leading to further performance improvement. Afterwards, an aging-constrained resource management technique is introduced with the goal of maximizing the overall system performance under an aging constraint.

The standby-sparing technique can improve system reliability while it might increase the temperature of the system beyond safe limits. In this paper, we propose a thermal-aware standby-sparing (TASS) technique that aims at maximizing the Quality of Service (QoS) of soft real-time tasks, which is defined as a function of the finishing time of running tasks. The proposed technique tolerates permanent and transient faults for multicore real-time embedded systems while meeting the Thermal Safe Power (TSP) as the core-level power constraint, which avoids thermal emergencies in on-chip systems. Executing the main and backup tasks on the cores at any power consumption below TSP guarantees that no thermal violation occurs. Our TASS proposed method provides an opportunity to remove the overlaps of the execution of main and backup tasks to prevent extra power consumption due to applying the fault-tolerant technique. Meanwhile, in order to maximize the QoS, we employ a heterogeneous platform to execute the main tasks as soon as possible on high-performance cores with more power budget. The backup tasks are executed on low power cores after finishing the main tasks. In this case, when the main task finishes successfully, the whole of its corresponding backup task can be dropped, resulting in a significant amount of power and temperature reduction. Therefore, in the fault-free scenarios, the spare cores can be powered down, and only the main tasks are scheduled and executed on the primary cores. Experiments show that our proposed method improves QoS up to 39.78% (on average by 18.40%) and reduces the peak power consumption and temperature by up to 40.21% and 15.47˚C (on average 28.31% and 13.60˚C), respectively, at runtime, while keeping the system reliability at the required level.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2022-10-01\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"d22528c248a10bb6fdafb72c7f9b1ada9f0ed8fc\",\r\n            \"citations\": 38,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"3265937\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"T.

To this end, Hybrid Application Mapping (HAM) methodologies combine design-time analysis with runtime mapping techniques to enable dynamic application mapping with performance guarantees, e.g., w.r.t. real-time constraints. They rely on composability to derive the required performance guarantees in an isolated analysis of individual applications at design time. The ongoing process technology downsizing, however, has given rise to an increased on-chip temperature, so that the thermal integrity of the platform must be monitored and enforced at run time by means of Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) techniques which use countermeasures e.g. DVFS and power gating. This, however, violates composability, as the thermally unsafe behavior of one application may trigger DTM countermeasures that affect other applications running in the thermally affected region which, in turn, may lead to the violation of their real-time constraints. As a remedy, this paper proposes, for the first time, a thermally composable HAM methodology that enforces thermal safety proactively at the launch time of applications and, thereby, prevents DTM interferences which react to thermal violations. To that end, we present (a) a novel thermal-safety analysis that can be integrated into the design-time analysis of HAM and (b) a set of thermal-safety admission checks that can be used at run time when launching an application. By establishing thermal composability among running applications, the proposed HAM approach enables providing thermally safe real-time guarantees for dynamically mapped applications in many-core systems.

In particular, technology scaling increases the processor susceptibility to radiation-induced transient faults. Moreover, technology scaling with the discontinuation of Dennard scaling increases the power densities, thereby temperatures, on the chip. High temperature, in turn, accelerates transistor aging mechanisms, which may ultimately lead to permanent faults on the chip. To assure a reliable system operation, despite these potential reliability concerns, fault-tolerance techniques have emerged. Specifically, fault-tolerance techniques employ some kind of redundancies to satisfy specific reliability requirements. However, the integration of fault-tolerance techniques into real-time embedded systems complicates preserving timing constraints. As a remedy, many task mapping/scheduling policies have been proposed to consider the integration of fault-tolerance techniques and enforce both timing and reliability guarantees for real-time embedded systems. More advanced techniques aim additionally at minimizing power and energy while at the same time satisfying timing and reliability constraints. Recently, some scheduling techniques have started to tackle a new challenge, which is the temperature increase induced by employing fault-tolerance techniques. These emerging techniques aim at satisfying temperature constraints besides timing and reliability constraints. This paper provides an in-depth survey of the emerging research efforts that exploit fault-tolerance techniques while considering timing, power/energy, and temperature from the real-time embedded systems’ design perspective. In particular, the task mapping/scheduling policies for faulttolerance real-time embedded systems are reviewed and classified according to their considered goals and constraints. Moreover, the employed fault-tolerance techniques, application models, and hardware models are considered as additional dimensions of the presented classification. Lastly, this survey gives deep insights into the main achievements and shortcomings of the existing approaches and highlights the most\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"be127b8793fa0c53835a8d024cc791c3df306452\",\r\n            \"citations\": 5,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"9250598\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Behnaz Pourmohseni\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"143742137\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"M.

However, the huge design space of possible task mappings, the unpredictable workload dynamism, and the numerous non-functional requirements of applications in terms of timing, reliability, safety, and so forth. impose significant challenges when designing many-core systems. Hybrid Application Mapping (HAM) is an emerging class of design methodologies for many-core systems which address these challenges via an incremental (per-application) mapping scheme: The mapping process is divided into (i) a design-time Design Space Exploration (DSE) step per application to obtain a set of high-quality mapping options and (ii) a run-time system management step in which applications are launched dynamically (on demand) using the precomputed mappings. This paper provides an overview of HAM and the design methodologies developed in line with it. We introduce the basics of HAM and elaborate on the way it addresses the major challenges of application mapping in many-core systems. We provide an overview of the main challenges encountered when employing HAM and survey a collection of state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies proposed to address these challenges. We finally present an overview of open topics and challenges in HAM, provide a summary of emerging trends for addressing them particularly using machine learning, and outline possible future directions. While there exists a large body of HAM methodologies, the techniques studied in this paper are developed, to a large extent, within the scope of invasive computing. Invasive computing introduces resource awareness into applications and employs explicit resource reservation to enable incremental application mapping and dynamic system management.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2020-11-17\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"https://www.mdpi.com/2079-9268/10/4/38/pdf?version=1605603039\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"c4fc3cddd12063611b9a9ed4ec4ba8ddbf14b51f\",\r\n            \"citations\": 0,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"153631156\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Mohsen Ansari\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2144694858\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Sepideh Safari\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2022561502\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Pourya Gohari-Nazari\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"J.

Checkpointing with rollback-recovery is a well-established technique to tolerate transient faults in multicore platforms. To consider the worst-case fault occurrence scenario, checkpointing technique requires to re-execute some parts of the tasks, and that might lead to simultaneous execution of task parts with high power consumptions, which eventually might result in a peak power increase beyond the thermal design power (TDP). Exceeding TDP can elevate on-chip temperatures beyond safe limits, and thereby triggering countermeasures that throttle down the voltage and frequency levels or power gate the cores. Such countermeasures might lead to violating task deadlines and degrading the system's reliability. To avoid such severe scenarios, it is inevitable to consider the impact of applying fault-tolerant techniques on the power consumption and prevent violating the power constraint of the chip, i.e., TDP. This article presents for the first time, a peak-power-aware checkpointing (PPAC) technique that tolerates a given number of faults, k, while at the same time meets the power constraint in hard real-time embedded systems. To do this, our proposed technique (PPAC) adjusts the timing of the checkpoints, which have lower power consumption than the tasks to the execution time points that have power spikes beyond TDP. Moreover, PPAC exploits the available slack times on the cores to delay the execution of some tasks to avoid the remaining power spikes beyond TDP, which could not be mitigated by solely adjusting checkpoints. To evaluate our technique, we extend the state-of-the-art system-level simulator, gem5, with the state-of-the-art checkpointing module in Linux. Our experimental results show that our proposed technique is able to tolerate a given number of faults without exceeding the timing and power constraints in hard real-time embedded systems. The resulting peak power reduction achieved by our technique compared to state-of-the-art techniques is an average of 23%. Moreover, our technique employs the Dynamic Power Management (DPM) during the slack times resulting at runtime in the case of fault-free scenarios, which provides energy savings with an average of 17.28% and up to 61.1%.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2022-12-01\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"e5f15f4132803a52b8cc4b2b247e1a004f59ccbf\",\r\n            \"citations\": 53,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"1970668\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Santiago Pagani\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"1740748\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"É.

The proposed technique then assigns applications to tiles by choosing their degree of parallelism and the voltage/frequency levels of each tile, such that the power density constraint is satisfied.

This mandates careful rationing of the power budget amongst the tasks for full exploitation of the many-core. Past research proposed power budgeting techniques that redistribute power budget amongst tasks based on up-to-date information about their current phases.

The proposed framework is developed using C++ and has been successfully used to compare mDTM and a variant of DsRem.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2020-03-01\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"cd8e466bead82073dd254686c3043961f80f94f2\",\r\n            \"citations\": 55,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"1970668\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Santiago Pagani\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"7558152\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Jian-Jia Chen\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"145063983\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"M.

The cooling solution is designed to dissipate this power level. But because TDP is not necessarily the maximum power that can be applied, chips are operated with Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) techniques. To avoid excessive triggers of DTM, usually, system designers also use TDP as power constraint. However, using a single and constant value as power constraint, e.g., TDP, can result in significant performance losses in homogeneous and heterogeneous manycore systems. Having better power budgeting techniques is a major step towards dealing with the dark silicon problem. This paper presents a new power budget concept, called Thermal Safe Power (TSP), which is an abstraction that provides safe power and power density constraints as a function of the number of simultaneously active cores. Executing cores at any power consumption below TSP ensures that DTM is not triggered. TSP can be computed offline for the worst cases, or online for a particular mapping of cores. TSP can also serve as a fundamental tool for guiding task partitioning and core mapping decisions, specially when core heterogeneity or timing guarantees are involved. Moreover, TSP results in dark silicon estimations which are less pessimistic than estimations using constant power budgets.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"8235ef01309d8317e4291b64e48902364488ee39\",\r\n            \"citations\": 6,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2069588231\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Martina Rapp\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"31365626\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Mohammed Bakr Sikal\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"J.

This paper demonstrates that this leads to suboptimal boosting decisions because the sensitivities of power and temperature also play a profound impact and need to be included within the optimization. Therefore, we introduce a novel boosting metric that integrates all relevant metrics: the application-dependent V/f sensitivities of performance and power, and the core-dependent sensitivity of the temperature. This new boosting metric is derived at run-time using machine learning via a neural network (NN) model, which accurately estimates the V/f sensitivities of performance and power of a priori unknown applications with diverse and time-varying characteristics. This new metric enables to build a smart, yet lightweight, boosting technique to maximize the performance under a temperature constraint.

In order to avoid aging-induced timing errors, designers employ guardbands either with respect to voltage or frequency. State-of-the-art techniques determine a guardband type at the circuit level at design time irrespective from the running workload at the system level. Our investigation revealed that generated temperatures by a running workload have the potential to play a key role in determining the appropriate guardband type with respect to system performance. Therefore, we propose a paradigm shift in designing guardbands: to select the guardband types on-the-fly with respect to the workload-induced temperatures aiming at optimizing for performance under temperature and reliability constraints. Moreover, different guardband types for different cores can be selected simultaneously when multiple applications with diverse properties suggest this to be useful. Our dynamic guardband selection allows for a higher performance compared to techniques that employ a fixed (at design time) guardband type throughout.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"d368fed35cfc6489dcdc22f15f998faa3320667d\",\r\n            \"citations\": 0,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"81650122\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Martin Rapp\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2165805657\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Nikita Krohmer\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"J.

Accurately forecasting future power changes is highly relevant for proactive power/thermal management. While forecasting power is straightforward for known or periodic workloads, the challenge for general unknown workloads at different voltage/frequency (v/n-levels is still unsolved. Our technique is based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) to forecast the average power consumption for both the next 1ms and 10ms periods. The runtime inputs for the LSTM RNN are current and past power information as well as performance counter readings. An LSTM RNN enables this forecasting due to its ability to preserve the history of power and performance counters. Our LSTM RNN needs to be trained only once at design-time while adapting during run-time to different system behavior through its internal memory. We demonstrate that our approach accurately forecasts power for unseen applications at different v/f-levels. The experimental results shows that the forecasts of our LSTM RNN provide 43% lower worst case error for the 1ms forecasts and 38% for the 10ms forecasts. comnared to the state of the art.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2021-02-01\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"fd363aabb9b04ccc1279ffbf7f87eee41a3dac37\",\r\n            \"citations\": 7,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2144694858\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Sepideh Safari\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2022561502\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Pourya Gohari-Nazari\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"153631156\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Mohsen Ansari\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"1784633\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"S.

The availability of multiple cores on a single chip provides opportunities to employ fault-tolerant techniques, to ensure the reliability of MCSs. However, applying fault-tolerant techniques increases the power consumption on the chip, and thereby, on-chip temperatures might increase beyond safe limits. To prevent thermal emergencies, urgent countermeasures, like DVFS or DPM will be triggered to cool down the chip. Such countermeasures, however, might not only lead to suspending low-criticality tasks, but also might lead to violating timing constraints of high-criticality tasks. Therefore, it is indispensable to consider a temperature constraint within the scheduling process of fault-tolerant MCSs. Therefore, this paper presents, for the first time, a thermal-aware scheduling scheme for fault-tolerant MCSs, named TherMa-MiCs, which satisfies the temperature constraint jointly with the timing constraints of the high-criticality tasks, while attempting to maximize the QoS of low-criticality tasks under the predefined constraints. At the same time, a reliability target is satisfied by employing the well-known N-Modular Redundancy fault-tolerant technique. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme meets the temperature and timing constraints, while at the same time, improving the QoS of low-criticality tasks, with an average of 44%.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"2124a1c52ce8393b5de4205c74ca555c4eaba90d\",\r\n            \"citations\": 1,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"81650122\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Martin Rapp\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2165805657\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Nikita Krohmer\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"J.

In particular, technology scaling increases the processor susceptibility to radiation-induced transient faults. Moreover, technology scaling with the discontinuation of Dennard scaling increases the power densities, thereby temperatures, on the chip. High temperature, in turn, accelerates transistor aging mechanisms, which may ultimately lead to permanent faults on the chip. To assure a reliable system operation, despite these potential reliability concerns, fault-tolerance techniques have emerged. Specifically, fault-tolerance techniques employ some kind of redundancies to satisfy specific reliability requirements. However, the integration of fault-tolerance techniques into real-time embedded systems complicates preserving timing constraints. As a remedy, many task mapping/scheduling policies have been proposed to consider the integration of fault-tolerance techniques and enforce both timing and reliability guarantees for real-time embedded systems. More advanced techniques aim additionally at minimizing power and energy while at the same time satisfying timing and reliability constraints. Recently, some scheduling techniques have started to tackle a new challenge, which is the temperature increase induced by employing fault-tolerance techniques. These emerging techniques aim at satisfying temperature constraints besides timing and reliability constraints. This paper provides an in-depth survey of the emerging research efforts that exploit fault-tolerance techniques while considering timing, power/energy, and temperature from the real-time embedded systems’ design perspective. In particular, the task mapping/scheduling policies for fault-tolerance real-time embedded systems are reviewed and classified according to their considered goals and constraints. Moreover, the employed fault-tolerance techniques, application models, and hardware models are considered as additional dimensions of the presented classification. Lastly, this survey gives deep insights into the main achievements and shortcomings of the existing approaches and highlights the most promising ones.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/ielx7/6287639/9668973/09684471.pdf\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"162db7a5a477d34209635f264f4d56642cdc8a34\",\r\n            \"citations\": 111,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"1970668\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Santiago Pagani\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"2726881\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Waqaas Munawar\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"7558152\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Jian-Jia Chen\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"145063983\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"M.

The cooling solution is designed to dissipate this power level. But because TDP is not necessarily the maximum power that can be applied, chips are operated with Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) techniques. To avoid excessive triggers of DTM, usually, system designers also use TDP as power constraint. However, using a single and constant value as power constraint, e.g., TDP, can result in big performance losses in many-core systems. Having better power budgeting techniques is a major step towards dealing with the dark silicon problem. This paper presents a new power budget concept, called Thermal Safe Power (TSP), which is an abstraction that provides safe power constraint values as a function of the number of simultaneously operating cores. Executing cores at any power consumption below TSP ensures that DTM is not triggered. TSP can be computed offline for the worst cases, or online for a particular mapping of cores. Our simulations show that using TSP as power constraint results in 50.5% and 14.2% higher average performance, compared to using constant power budgets (both per-chip and per-core) and a boosting technique, respectively. Moreover, TSP results in dark silicon estimations which are more optimistic than estimations using constant power budgets.\",\r\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2014-10-12\",\r\n            \"reference\": null,\r\n            \"url\": \"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2656075.2656103\",\r\n            \"venueNames\": [\r\n                \"N/A\"\r\n            ],\r\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\r\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\r\n        },\r\n        {\r\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\r\n            \"id\": \"a141c558a7add5ecae33b38003eb34516b95393f\",\r\n            \"citations\": 17,\r\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\r\n            \"authors\": [\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"1970668\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"Santiago Pagani\"\r\n                },\r\n                {\r\n                    \"authorId\": \"145063983\",\r\n                    \"name\": \"M.

Hence, a resource management technique, that allocates cores to application aiming at maximizing the system performance, will not be able to achieve its goal without taking into account the on-chip temperature and its impact on the availability of the chip's resources. However, considering a temperature constraint by the resource management will further increase its complexity, especially in manycores, and thus implementing it in a centralized scheme might lead to a computation bottleneck and a single point of failure. To avoid such scenarios, it is inevitable to distribute the computation required by the resource management technique throughout the chip. In this article, we propose a distributed resource management technique that considers temperature as an essential factor in allocating cores to applications and determining the power states of these cores and their voltage/frequency levels, while taking into account the performance models of the applications in order to maximize the overall system performance under a temperature constraint. Our proposed technique employs, for the first time, combinatorial auctions within an agent system to achieve the targeted goal in a distributed manner.

We developed and tested a scalable, online, 4-session growth mindset intervention at 7 universities, across 16 introductory computer science classes (N = 491). The intervention did not have a significant total effect on academic performance, although it indirectly improved grades via value. Additionally, the intervention, relative to the control, improved interest in the field and value also mediated this effect.

This includes afferent information from muscles, joints, and skin, as well as visual feedback to plan, initiate, and execute motor output. In tetraplegia, this neural communication is interrupted in both directions at the level of the spinal cord. Brain–computer interfaces have been developed to produce voluntary motor output controlled by directly recording from brain activity. Flesher et al. added an afferent channel to the brain–computer interface to mimic sensory input from the skin of a hand (see the Perspective by Faisal). The improvements achieved by adding the afferent input were substantial in a battery of motor tasks tested in a human subject. Science, abd0380, this issue p. 831; see also abi7262, p. 791 Creating artificial tactile feedback greatly improves the ability of a person with tetraplegia to manipulate objects with a robotic limb. Prosthetic arms controlled by a brain-computer interface can enable people with tetraplegia to perform functional movements. However, vision provides limited feedback because information about grasping objects is best relayed through tactile feedback. We supplemented vision with tactile percepts evoked using a bidirectional brain-computer interface that records neural activity from the motor cortex and generates tactile sensations through intracortical microstimulation of the somatosensory cortex. This enabled a person with tetraplegia to substantially improve performance with a robotic limb; trial times on a clinical upper-limb assessment were reduced by half, from a median time of 20.9 to 10.2 seconds. Faster times were primarily due to less time spent attempting to grasp objects, revealing that mimicking known biological control principles results in task performance that is closer to able-bodied human abilities.\",\n        \"publicationDate\": \"2021-05-21\",\n        \"reference\": \"@['JournalArticle']{Flesher2021ABI,\\n author = {Sharlene N.

However, there is a lack of validated assessment tools aligned to core CS concepts for younger students. This paper reports on the development and validation of a CS concept assessment for middle grades (ages 11-13) students. A total of 27 multiple-choice items were developed, guided by focal knowledge, skills and abilities associated with the concepts of variables, loops, conditionals, and algorithms. These items were administered to 457 middle grades students. The items were presented in form of block-based programming code and administered in a week-long computational modeling intervention. A combination of classical test theory and item response theory approaches were used to validate the assessment. Based on results, it was found that only 24 items are considered valid and reliable items to measure CS conceptual understanding. The results also suggested that the assessment can be used as a pre and post-test to investigate students’ learning gains. This work fills an important gap by providing a key resource for researchers and practitioners interested in assessing middle grades student CS conceptual understanding.\",\n        \"publicationDate\": \"2020-02-14\",\n        \"reference\": \"@None{Wiebe2020DevelopmentAV,\\n author = {E.

A multicore processor can be exploited by executing multiple applications simultaneously on the chip. Furthermore, multiple threads of each application can be also executed in parallel on multiple cores. To optimize for performance in multicores, it is necessary to employ resource management techniques that manage the resources of the chip considering the running applications. Specifically, resource management can allocate more cores to applications to exploit their parallelism and upscale the voltage and frequency levels (V/f levels) of the cores to increase their speeds. While such potential decisions of resource management improve the performance, they may, unfortunately, elevate the on-chip temperatures, which have negative impacts on reliability. One of the major temperature-dependent reliability concerns is the circuit aging. In particular, aging leads to an increase in the threshold voltage, which, in turn, may increase the delay of the processor’s paths and eventually induce timing errors. Due to the adverse impacts of temperature and aging on reliability, they have been considered as dire design constraints. Therefore, this dissertation focuses on the relevant problem of performance optimization under temperature and aging constraints. To achieve this goal, several resource management techniques are introduced in this dissertation to maximize the overall system performance, while satisfying temperature and aging constraints within the decision making process. Firstly, temperature-constrained resource management techniques are proposed for homogenous and heterogeneous multicores. These techniques allocate cores to multithreaded applications, indicating the number of parallel threads of each application, and determine the V/f level of the cores that execute each application. These decisions are conducted while taking into account the Thread Level Parallelism (TLP) and the Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) of the applications, aiming at maximizing the overall system performance under a temperature constraint. Moreover, the positioning of inactive (power-gated) cores throughout the chip is selected such that they facilitate dissipating the generated heat from active cores. That, in turn, reduces the temperature of active cores and allows upscaling their V/f levels leading to further performance improvement. Afterwards, an aging-constrained resource management technique is introduced with the goal of maximizing the overall system performance under an aging constraint. Towards achieving this goal, an aging-aware design space is explored, which translates temperature and voltage into the resulting amount of aging quantified as an increase\",\n        \"publicationDate\": \"\",\n        \"reference\": null,\n        \"url\": \"\",\n        \"venueNames\": [\n            \"N/A\"\n        ],\n        \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\n        \"issn\": \"N/A\"\n    },\n    {\n        \"type\": \"paper\",\n        \"id\": \"745a183826d117abbd992926fb08e10d9d0fbb0e\",\n        \"citations\": 0,\n        \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\n        \"authors\": [\n            {\n                \"authorId\": \"1739035105\",\n                \"name\": \"Marcel Mettler\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"authorId\": \"81650122\",\n                \"name\": \"Martin Rapp\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\n                \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"authorId\": \"1397424763\",\n                \"name\": \"Daniel Mueller-Gritschneder\"\n            },\n            {\n                \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\n                \"name\": \"J.

In particular, technology scaling increases the processor susceptibility to radiation-induced transient faults. Moreover, technology scaling with the discontinuation of Dennard scaling increases the power densities, thereby temperatures, on the chip. High temperature, in turn, accelerates transistor aging mechanisms, which may ultimately lead to permanent faults on the chip. To assure a reliable system operation, despite these potential reliability concerns, fault-tolerance techniques have emerged. Specifically, fault-tolerance techniques employ some kind of redundancies to satisfy specific reliability requirements. However, the integration of fault-tolerance techniques into real-time embedded systems complicates preserving timing constraints. As a remedy, many task mapping/scheduling policies have been proposed to consider the integration of fault-tolerance techniques and enforce both timing and reliability guarantees for real-time embedded systems. More advanced techniques aim additionally at minimizing power and energy while at the same time satisfying timing and reliability constraints. Recently, some scheduling techniques have started to tackle a new challenge, which is the temperature increase induced by employing fault-tolerance techniques. These emerging techniques aim at satisfying temperature constraints besides timing and reliability constraints. This paper provides an in-depth survey of the emerging research efforts that exploit fault-tolerance techniques while considering timing, power/energy, and temperature from the real-time embedded systems’ design perspective. In particular, the task mapping/scheduling policies for faulttolerance real-time embedded systems are reviewed and classified according to their considered goals and constraints. Moreover, the employed fault-tolerance techniques, application models, and hardware models are considered as additional dimensions of the presented classification.

This necessitates the need to realize efficient mapping methodologies for such complex computing platforms. This paper provides an extensive survey and categorization of state-of-the-art mapping methodologies and highlights the emerging trends for multi/many-core systems. The methodologies aim at optimizing system's resource usage, performance, power consumption, temperature distribution and reliability for varying application models. The methodologies perform design-time and run-time optimization for static and dynamic workload scenarios, respectively. These optimizations are necessary to fulfill the end-user demands. Comparison of the methodologies based on their optimization aim has been provided.

An error correction unit is integrated to provide accurate results for cases where high accuracy is required. Furthermore, an associated scheme for error probability estimation allows convenient comparison of different approximate adder configurations without requiring the need to numerically simulate the adder. Our experimental results validate the developed error model and also the lower latency of our generic accuracy configurable adder over state-of-the-art approximate adders.

This paper presents an overview of several research efforts that propose to use machine learning (ML) techniques for power and thermal management on single-core and multicore processors. Traditional power and thermal management techniques rely on a certain a-priori knowledge of the chip’s thermal model, as well as information of the workloads/applications to be executed (e.g., transient and average power consumption). Nevertheless, these a-priori information is not always available, and even if it is, it cannot reflect the spatial and temporal uncertainties and variations that come from the environment, the hardware, or from the workloads/applications. Contrarily, techniques based on ML can potentially adapt to varying system conditions and workloads, learning from past events in order to improve themselves as the environment changes, resulting in improved management decisions.\",\n        \"publicationDate\": \"2020-01-01\",\n        \"reference\": \"@['JournalArticle', 'Review']{Pagani2020MachineLF,\\n author = {Santiago Pagani and P.

To enable cross-layer approximate computing, bridging the gap between the logic layer (i.e. arithmetic blocks) and the architecture layer (and even considering the software layers) is crucial. Towards this end, this paper introduces open-source libraries of low-power and high-performance approximate components. The elementary approximate arithmetic blocks (adder and multiplier) are used to develop multi-bit approximate arithmetic blocks and accelerators. An analysis of data-driven resilience and error propagation is discussed.

Especially, embedded system applications rely more and more on the utilization of convolutional NNs to provide services such as image/audio classification and object detection. The core arithmetic computation performed during NN inference is the multiply-accumulate (MAC) operation. In order to meet tighter and tighter throughput constraints, NN accelerators integrate thousands of MAC units resulting in a significant increase in power consumption. Approximate computing is established as a design alternative to improve the efficiency of computing systems by trading computational accuracy for high energy savings. In this work, we bring approximate computing principles and NN inference together by designing NN specific approximate multipliers that feature multiple accuracy levels at run-time. We propose a time-efficient automated framework for mapping the NN weights to the accuracy levels of the approximate reconfigurable accelerator. The proposed weight-oriented approximation mapping is able to satisfy tight accuracy loss thresholds, while significantly reducing energy consumption without any need for intensive NN retraining. Our approach is evaluated against several NNs demonstrating that it delivers high energy savings (17.8% on average) with a minimal loss in inference accuracy (0.5%).\",\n        \"publicationDate\": \"2020-09-04\",\n        \"reference\": \"@['JournalArticle']{Tasoulas2020Weight-OrientedAF,\\n author = {Zois-Gerasimos Tasoulas and Georgios Zervakis and Iraklis Anagnostopoulos and H.

Generation and exploration of such a design space enables a wide-range of multipliers with varying approximation levels, each exhibiting distinct area, power, and output quality, and thereby facilitates approximate computing at higher abstraction levels. We synthesized our designs using Synopsys Design Compiler with a TSMC 45nm technology library and verified using ModelSim gate-level simulations. Power and quality evaluations for various designs are performed using PrimeTime and behavioral models, respectively. The selected designs are then deployed in a JPEG application. For reproducibility and to facilitate further research and development at higher abstraction layers, we have released the RTL and behavioral models of these approximate multipliers and adders as an open-source library at https://sourceforge.net/projects/lpaclib/.\",\n        \"publicationDate\": \"2016-11-07\",\n        \"reference\": \"@['Book', 'JournalArticle', 'Conference']{Rehman2016Architectural-spaceEO,\\n author = {Semeen Rehman and Walaa El-Harouni and M.

In this paper, we propose and implement an automatic and circuit independent design framework that generates approximate circuits with dynamically reconfigurable accuracy at runtime. The generated circuits feature varying accuracy levels, supporting also accurate execution. Extensive experimental evaluation, using industry strength flow and circuits, demonstrates that our generated approximate circuits improve the energy by up to 41% for 2% error bound and by 17.5% on average under a pessimistic scenario that assumes full accuracy requirement in the 33% of the runtime. To demonstrate further the efficiency of our framework, we considered two state-of-the-art technology libraries which are a 7nm conventional FinFET and an emerging technology that boosts performance at a high cost of increased dynamic power.\",\n        \"publicationDate\": \"\",\n        \"reference\": \"@['JournalArticle']{Zervakis2020DesignAO,\\n author = {Georgios Zervakis and H.

To avoid Big Data issues (e.g. high latency of cloud based IoT), the processing of the captured data is starting from the IoT edge node. However, the available processing capabilities and energy resources are still limited and do not allow to fully process the data on-board. It calls for offloading some portions of computation to the gateway or servers. Due to the limited bandwidth of the IoT gateways, choosing the offloading levels of connected devices and allocating bandwidth to them is a challenging problem. This paper proposes a technique for managing computation offloading in a local IoT network under bandwidth constraints. The existing bandwidth allocation and computation offloading management techniques underutilize the gateway's resources (e.g. bandwidth) due to the fragmentation issue. This issue stems from the discrete coarse-grained choices (i.e. offloading levels) on the IoT end nodes. Our proposed technique addresses this issue, and utilizes the available resources of the gateway effectively. The experimental results show on average 1 hour (up to 1.5 hour) improvement in battery life of edge devices.

Cloud-centric processing approaches for the IoT data suffer from high and unpredictable network latency, which causes poor experience in real-time IoT applications, such as healthcare. To address this issue, in edge computing, the data inference starts from the data source (i.e., the IoT devices). However, the constrained computational capabilities of the IoT device and the power-hungry data transmission demand a tradeoff between onboard processing and computation offloading. Hence, the IoT information inference requires efficient and lightweight techniques that are tailored for this tradeoff and respect the constrained resources on IoT devices, such as wearables. This article presents a hierarchical classification approach that decomposes the problem into three classifiers in two hierarchy layers. In the first layer, a lightweight classifier executes directly on the IoT device and decides whether to offload the computation to the gateway or to perform it onboard. The second layer comprises a lightweight classifier on the IoT device (can only distinguish a subset of classes) and a complex classifier on the gateway (to distinguish the remaining classes). The experimental results (using a real-world data set for human activity recognition and implemented on a wearable IoT device) show higher accuracy (92% on average) than a nonhierarchical classifier (87% on average). The execution time and power measurements on the IoT device show $3\\\\times $ energy saving for the classification.\",\n        \"publicationDate\": \"2020-04-21\",\n        \"reference\": \"@['JournalArticle']{Samie2020HierarchicalCF,\\n author = {Farzad Samie and L.

The cooling solution is designed to dissipate this power level. But because TDP is not necessarily the maximum power that can be applied, chips are operated with Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) techniques. To avoid excessive triggers of DTM, usually, system designers also use TDP as power constraint. However, using a single and constant value as power constraint, e.g., TDP, can result in big performance losses in many-core systems. Having better power budgeting techniques is a major step towards dealing with the dark silicon problem. This paper presents a new power budget concept, called Thermal Safe Power (TSP), which is an abstraction that provides safe power constraint values as a function of the number of simultaneously operating cores. Executing cores at any power consumption below TSP ensures that DTM is not triggered. TSP can be computed offline for the worst cases, or online for a particular mapping of cores. Our simulations show that using TSP as power constraint results in 50.5% and 14.2% higher average performance, compared to using constant power budgets (both per-chip and per-core) and a boosting technique, respectively.

In this work, we are the first to investigate the thermal challenges that NPUs bring, revealing how MAC arrays, which form the heart of any NPU, impose serious thermal bottlenecks to on-chip systems due to their excessive power densities. For the first time, we explore: 1) the effectiveness of precision scaling and frequency scaling (FS) in temperature reductions and 2) how advanced on-chip cooling using superlattice thin-film thermoelectric (TE) open doors for new tradeoffs between temperature, throughput, cooling cost, and inference accuracy in NPU chips. Our work unveils that hybrid thermal management, which composes different means to reduce the NPU temperature, is a key. To achieve that, we propose and implement PFS-TE technique that couples precision and FS together with superlattice TE cooling for effective NPU thermal management. Using commercial signoff tools, we obtain accurate power and timing analysis of MAC arrays after a full-chip design is performed based on 14-nm Intel FinFET technology. Then, multiphysics simulations using finite-element methods are carried out for accurate heat simulations in the presence and absence of on-chip cooling. Afterward, comprehensive design-space exploration is presented to demonstrate the Pareto frontier and the existing tradeoffs between temperature reductions, power overheads due to cooling, throughput, and inference accuracy. Using a wide range of NNs trained for image classification, experimental results demonstrate that our novel NPU thermal management increases the inference efficiency (TOPS/Joule) by $1.33\\\\times $ , $1.87\\\\times $ , and $2\\\\times $ under different temperature constraints; 105 °C, 85 °C, and 70 °C, respectively, while the average accuracy drops merely from 89.0% to 85.5%.\",\n        \"publicationDate\": \"2020-10-02\",\n        \"reference\": \"@['JournalArticle']{Amrouch2020NPUTM,\\n author = {H.

Reliability-aware circuit design flows do virtually not exist and even research is in its infancy. In this paper, we propose to bring aging awareness to EDA tool flows based on so-called degradation-aware cell libraries. These libraries include detailed delay information of gates/cells under the impact that aging has on both threshold voltage (Vth) and carrier mobility (μ) of transistors. This is unlike state of the art which considers Vth only. We show how ignoring ß degradation leads to underestimating guard-bands by 19% on average. Our investigation revealed that the impact of aging is strongly dependent on the operating conditions of gates (i.e. input signal slew and output load capacitance), and not solely on the duty cycle of transistors. Neglecting this fact results in employing insufficient guard-bands and thus not sustaining reliability during lifetime. We demonstrate that degradation-aware libraries and tool flows are indispensable for not only accurately estimating guardbands, but also efficiently containing them. By considering aging degradations during logic synthesis, significantly more resilient circuits can be obtained. We further quantify the impact of aging on the degradation of image processing circuits. This goes far beyond investigating aging with respect to path delays solely. We show that in a standard design without any guardbanding, aging leads to unacceptable image quality after just one year. By contrast, if the synthesis tool is provided with the degradation-aware cell library, high image quality is sustained for 10 years (even under worst-case aging and without a guardband). Hence, using our approach, aging can be effectively suppressed.\",\n        \"publicationDate\": \"2016-06-05\",\n        \"reference\": \"@['JournalArticle', 'Book', 'Conference']{Amrouch2016Reliability-awareDT,\\n author = {H.

We therefore propose to use Thermal Safe Power (TSP) as a more efficient power budget. It is also shown that sophisticated spatio-temporal mapping decisions result in improved thermal profiles with reduced peak temperatures.

Two knobs affect these factors: First, the mapping of threads to cores affects both the LLC latencies and the power budgets. Second, dynamic power budgeting refines the power budgets during task execution. A mapping that spatially distributes threads across the many-core increases the power budgets, but unfortunately also increases the LLC latencies. Contrarily, mapping all threads near the center of the many-core minimizes the LLC latencies, but unfortunately also decreases the power budgets. Consequently, both metrics cannot be simultaneously optimal, which leads to a Pareto-optimization for task mapping that has formerly not been exploited. Dynamic power budgeting reallocates the power budgets according to the tasks’ execution phases. This results in a dynamically changing non-uniform power budget, which further increases the performance. We are the first to present a run-time algorithm PCGov combining task-agnostic task mapping and task-aware dynamic power budgeting for many-cores with shared distributed LLC. PCGov yields up to 21 percent lower response time and 13 percent lower energy consumption compared to the state-of-the-art, with a low overhead of less than 0.5 percent.\",\n        \"publicationDate\": \"2020-01-01\",\n        \"reference\": \"@['JournalArticle']{Rapp2020Power-AC,\\n author = {Martin Rapp and Mark Sagi and A.

Our approach reduces the overall traffic produced to collect the current state of the system (monitoring-traffic), needed for runtime mapping, compared to a centralized mapping scheme. In our experiment, we obtain 10.7 times lower monitoring traffic compared to the centralized mapping scheme proposed in [8] for a 64 times 64 NoC.

However, due to the Thermal Design Power (TDP) constraint, it is not possible to continuously operate all cores at the same time. Exceeding the TDP constraint may activate the Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) to ensure thermal stability. Such hardware based closed-loop safeguards pose a big challenge in using many-core chips for real-time tasks. Managing the worst-case peak power usage of a chip can help toward resolving this issue. We present a scheme to minimize the peak power usage for frame-based and periodic real-time tasks on many-core processors by scheduling the sleep cycles for each active core and introduce the concept of a sufficient test for peak power consumption for task feasibility. We consider both inter-task and inter-core diversity in terms of power usage and present computationally efficient algorithms for peak power minimization for these cases, i.e., a special case of “homogeneous tasks on homogeneous cores” to the general case of “heterogeneous tasks on heterogeneous cores”. We evaluate our solution through extensive simulations using the 48-core SCC platform and gem5 architecture simulator. Our simulation results show the efficacy of our scheme.\",\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2014-12-01\",\n            \"reference\": null,\n            \"url\": \"\",\n            \"venueNames\": [\n                \"N/A\"\n            ],\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\n            \"id\": \"3b932f41bcef0726397f9100e706587a51e05ed8\",\n            \"citations\": 89,\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\n            \"authors\": [\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\n                    \"name\": \"J.

We therefore propose to use Thermal Safe Power (TSP) as a more efficient power budget.

Therefore, we present, for the first time, an field-programmable gate array (FPGA)-based evaluation approach to test and compare thermal and resource management strategies using the combination of benchmark generation, FPGA-based application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) emulation, and run-time monitoring. The proposed benchmark generation method enables an evaluation of run-time management strategies for applications with various run-time characteristics. Furthermore, the ASIC emulation platform features a novel distributed temperature emulator design, whose overhead scales linearly with the number of integrated cores, and a novel dynamic voltage frequency scaling emulator design, which precisely models the timing and energy overhead of voltage and frequency transitions. In our evaluations, we demonstrate the proposed approach for a tiled many-core processor with 80 cores on four Virtex-7 FPGAs.

However, due to the discontinuation of Dennard scaling, on-chip power densities are continuously increasing along with technology scaling, and hence on-chip temperatures are elevated. Therefore, several thermal management techniques have emerged to keep the temperature of the chip within safe limits. These techniques, however, lead to performance losses which ultimately erase a big portion of the expected performance gains from the heterogeneous multicores. Thus, it is indispensable to deploy thermal management techniques that are able to make efficient decisions which satisfy temperature constraints while at the same time maximizing the performance.

For instance, the competition for last-level cache by concurrently-running applications may lead to slowing down the execution and to potentially violating individual performance constraints. Clustered many-cores reduce cache contention at chip level by sharing caches only at cluster level. To reduce cache con-tention within a cluster, state-of-the art techniques aim to co-map a memory-intensive application with a compute-intensive application onto one cluster. However, compute-intensive applications typ-ically consume high power, and therefore, executing another application in their nearby cores may lead to high temperatures. Hence, there is a trade-off between cache contention and temperature. This paper is the first to consider this trade-off through a novel thermal- and cache-aware resource management technique. We build a neural network (NN)-based model to predict the slowdown of the application execution induced by cache contention feeding our resource management technique that then optimizes the application mapping and selects the voltage/frequency levels of the clus-ters to compensate for the potential contention-induced slowdown. Thereby, it meets the performance constraints, while minimizing temperature. Compared to the state of the art, our technique significantly reduces the temperature by 30% on average, while satisfying performance constraints of all individual applications.\",\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2022-03-14\",\n            \"reference\": null,\n            \"url\": \"\",\n            \"venueNames\": [\n                \"N/A\"\n            ],\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\n            \"id\": \"5f93fe9040018f4dab516b1be8db5ada99e0c501\",\n            \"citations\": 0,\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\n            \"authors\": [\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\n                }\n            ],\n            \"title\": \"Resource Management for Multicores to Optimize Performance under Temperature and Aging Constraints\",\n            \"abstractText\": \"Driven by the ever-increasing performance demand, multicore processors have emerged enabling concurrent computations on a single chip. A multicore processor can be exploited by executing multiple applications simultaneously on the chip. Furthermore, multiple threads of each application can be also executed in parallel on multiple cores. To optimize for performance in multicores, it is necessary to employ resource management techniques that manage the resources of the chip considering the running applications. Specifically, resource management can allocate more cores to applications to exploit their parallelism and upscale the voltage and frequency levels (V/f levels) of the cores to increase their speeds. While such potential decisions of resource management improve the performance, they may, unfortunately, elevate the on-chip temperatures, which have negative impacts on reliability. One of the major temperature-dependent reliability concerns is the circuit aging. In particular, aging leads to an increase in the threshold voltage, which, in turn, may increase the delay of the processor’s paths and eventually induce timing errors. Due to the adverse impacts of temperature and aging on reliability, they have been considered as dire design constraints. Therefore, this dissertation focuses on the relevant problem of performance optimization under temperature and aging constraints. To achieve this goal, several resource management techniques are introduced in this dissertation to maximize the overall system performance, while satisfying temperature and aging constraints within the decision making process. Firstly, temperature-constrained resource management techniques are proposed for homogenous and heterogeneous multicores. These techniques allocate cores to multithreaded applications, indicating the number of parallel threads of each application, and determine the V/f level of the cores that execute each application. These decisions are conducted while taking into account the Thread Level Parallelism (TLP) and the Instruction Level Parallelism (ILP) of the applications, aiming at maximizing the overall system performance under a temperature constraint. Moreover, the positioning of inactive (power-gated) cores throughout the chip is selected such that they facilitate dissipating the generated heat from active cores. That, in turn, reduces the temperature of active cores and allows upscaling their V/f levels leading to further performance improvement. Afterwards, an aging-constrained resource management technique is introduced with the goal of maximizing the overall system performance under an aging constraint. Towards achieving this goal, an aging-aware design space is explored, which translates temperature and voltage into the resulting amount of aging quantified as an increase\",\n            \"publicationDate\": \"\",\n            \"reference\": null,\n            \"url\": \"\",\n            \"venueNames\": [\n                \"N/A\"\n            ],\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\n            \"id\": \"745a183826d117abbd992926fb08e10d9d0fbb0e\",\n            \"citations\": 0,\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\n            \"authors\": [\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"1739035105\",\n                    \"name\": \"Marcel Mettler\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"81650122\",\n                    \"name\": \"Martin Rapp\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"1397424763\",\n                    \"name\": \"Daniel Mueller-Gritschneder\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\n                    \"name\": \"J.

The standby-sparing technique can improve system reliability while it might increase the temperature of the system beyond safe limits. In this paper, we propose a thermal-aware standby-sparing (TASS) technique that aims at maximizing the Quality of Service (QoS) of soft real-time tasks, which is defined as a function of the finishing time of running tasks. The proposed technique tolerates permanent and transient faults for multicore real-time embedded systems while meeting the Thermal Safe Power (TSP) as the core-level power constraint, which avoids thermal emergencies in on-chip systems. Executing the main and backup tasks on the cores at any power consumption below TSP guarantees that no thermal violation occurs. Our TASS proposed method provides an opportunity to remove the overlaps of the execution of main and backup tasks to prevent extra power consumption due to applying the fault-tolerant technique. Meanwhile, in order to maximize the QoS, we employ a heterogeneous platform to execute the main tasks as soon as possible on high-performance cores with more power budget. The backup tasks are executed on low power cores after finishing the main tasks. In this case, when the main task finishes successfully, the whole of its corresponding backup task can be dropped, resulting in a significant amount of power and temperature reduction. Therefore, in the fault-free scenarios, the spare cores can be powered down, and only the main tasks are scheduled and executed on the primary cores. Experiments show that our proposed method improves QoS up to 39.78% (on average by 18.40%) and reduces the peak power consumption and temperature by up to 40.21% and 15.47˚C (on average 28.31% and 13.60˚C), respectively, at runtime, while keeping the system reliability at the required level.\",\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2022-10-01\",\n            \"reference\": null,\n            \"url\": \"\",\n            \"venueNames\": [\n                \"N/A\"\n            ],\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\n            \"id\": \"d22528c248a10bb6fdafb72c7f9b1ada9f0ed8fc\",\n            \"citations\": 38,\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\n            \"authors\": [\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"3265937\",\n                    \"name\": \"T.

To this end, Hybrid Application Mapping (HAM) methodologies combine design-time analysis with runtime mapping techniques to enable dynamic application mapping with performance guarantees, e.g., w.r.t. real-time constraints. They rely on composability to derive the required performance guarantees in an isolated analysis of individual applications at design time. The ongoing process technology downsizing, however, has given rise to an increased on-chip temperature, so that the thermal integrity of the platform must be monitored and enforced at run time by means of Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) techniques which use countermeasures e.g. DVFS and power gating. This, however, violates composability, as the thermally unsafe behavior of one application may trigger DTM countermeasures that affect other applications running in the thermally affected region which, in turn, may lead to the violation of their real-time constraints. As a remedy, this paper proposes, for the first time, a thermally composable HAM methodology that enforces thermal safety proactively at the launch time of applications and, thereby, prevents DTM interferences which react to thermal violations. To that end, we present (a) a novel thermal-safety analysis that can be integrated into the design-time analysis of HAM and (b) a set of thermal-safety admission checks that can be used at run time when launching an application. By establishing thermal composability among running applications, the proposed HAM approach enables providing thermally safe real-time guarantees for dynamically mapped applications in many-core systems.

In particular, technology scaling increases the processor susceptibility to radiation-induced transient faults. Moreover, technology scaling with the discontinuation of Dennard scaling increases the power densities, thereby temperatures, on the chip. High temperature, in turn, accelerates transistor aging mechanisms, which may ultimately lead to permanent faults on the chip. To assure a reliable system operation, despite these potential reliability concerns, fault-tolerance techniques have emerged. Specifically, fault-tolerance techniques employ some kind of redundancies to satisfy specific reliability requirements. However, the integration of fault-tolerance techniques into real-time embedded systems complicates preserving timing constraints. As a remedy, many task mapping/scheduling policies have been proposed to consider the integration of fault-tolerance techniques and enforce both timing and reliability guarantees for real-time embedded systems. More advanced techniques aim additionally at minimizing power and energy while at the same time satisfying timing and reliability constraints. Recently, some scheduling techniques have started to tackle a new challenge, which is the temperature increase induced by employing fault-tolerance techniques. These emerging techniques aim at satisfying temperature constraints besides timing and reliability constraints. This paper provides an in-depth survey of the emerging research efforts that exploit fault-tolerance techniques while considering timing, power/energy, and temperature from the real-time embedded systems’ design perspective. In particular, the task mapping/scheduling policies for faulttolerance real-time embedded systems are reviewed and classified according to their considered goals and constraints.

However, the huge design space of possible task mappings, the unpredictable workload dynamism, and the numerous non-functional requirements of applications in terms of timing, reliability, safety, and so forth. impose significant challenges when designing many-core systems. Hybrid Application Mapping (HAM) is an emerging class of design methodologies for many-core systems which address these challenges via an incremental (per-application) mapping scheme: The mapping process is divided into (i) a design-time Design Space Exploration (DSE) step per application to obtain a set of high-quality mapping options and (ii) a run-time system management step in which applications are launched dynamically (on demand) using the precomputed mappings. This paper provides an overview of HAM and the design methodologies developed in line with it. We introduce the basics of HAM and elaborate on the way it addresses the major challenges of application mapping in many-core systems. We provide an overview of the main challenges encountered when employing HAM and survey a collection of state-of-the-art techniques and methodologies proposed to address these challenges. We finally present an overview of open topics and challenges in HAM, provide a summary of emerging trends for addressing them particularly using machine learning, and outline possible future directions. While there exists a large body of HAM methodologies, the techniques studied in this paper are developed, to a large extent, within the scope of invasive computing.

Checkpointing with rollback-recovery is a well-established technique to tolerate transient faults in multicore platforms. To consider the worst-case fault occurrence scenario, checkpointing technique requires to re-execute some parts of the tasks, and that might lead to simultaneous execution of task parts with high power consumptions, which eventually might result in a peak power increase beyond the thermal design power (TDP). Exceeding TDP can elevate on-chip temperatures beyond safe limits, and thereby triggering countermeasures that throttle down the voltage and frequency levels or power gate the cores. Such countermeasures might lead to violating task deadlines and degrading the system's reliability. To avoid such severe scenarios, it is inevitable to consider the impact of applying fault-tolerant techniques on the power consumption and prevent violating the power constraint of the chip, i.e., TDP. This article presents for the first time, a peak-power-aware checkpointing (PPAC) technique that tolerates a given number of faults, k, while at the same time meets the power constraint in hard real-time embedded systems. To do this, our proposed technique (PPAC) adjusts the timing of the checkpoints, which have lower power consumption than the tasks to the execution time points that have power spikes beyond TDP. Moreover, PPAC exploits the available slack times on the cores to delay the execution of some tasks to avoid the remaining power spikes beyond TDP, which could not be mitigated by solely adjusting checkpoints. To evaluate our technique, we extend the state-of-the-art system-level simulator, gem5, with the state-of-the-art checkpointing module in Linux. Our experimental results show that our proposed technique is able to tolerate a given number of faults without exceeding the timing and power constraints in hard real-time embedded systems. The resulting peak power reduction achieved by our technique compared to state-of-the-art techniques is an average of 23%.

For such architectures, we present a resource management technique that introduces power density as a novel system level constraint, in order to avoid thermal violations. The proposed technique then assigns applications to tiles by choosing their degree of parallelism and the voltage/frequency levels of each tile, such that the power density constraint is satisfied.

Furthermore, the ability of a task to exploit part of the power budget allocated to it depends upon its current execution phase. This mandates careful rationing of the power budget amongst the tasks for full exploitation of the many-core. Past research proposed power budgeting techniques that redistribute power budget amongst tasks based on up-to-date information about their current phases. This phase information needs to be constantly propagated throughout the system and processed, inhibiting scalability. In this work, we propose a novel probabilistic technique for power budgeting which requires no exchange of phase information yet provides mathematical guarantees on judicial use of the TDP.

The cooling solution is designed to dissipate this power level. But because TDP is not necessarily the maximum power that can be applied, chips are operated with Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) techniques. To avoid excessive triggers of DTM, usually, system designers also use TDP as power constraint. However, using a single and constant value as power constraint, e.g., TDP, can result in significant performance losses in homogeneous and heterogeneous manycore systems. Having better power budgeting techniques is a major step towards dealing with the dark silicon problem. This paper presents a new power budget concept, called Thermal Safe Power (TSP), which is an abstraction that provides safe power and power density constraints as a function of the number of simultaneously active cores. Executing cores at any power consumption below TSP ensures that DTM is not triggered. TSP can be computed offline for the worst cases, or online for a particular mapping of cores. TSP can also serve as a fundamental tool for guiding task partitioning and core mapping decisions, specially when core heterogeneity or timing guarantees are involved. Moreover, TSP results in dark silicon estimations which are less pessimistic than estimations using constant power budgets.\",\n            \"publicationDate\": \"\",\n            \"reference\": null,\n            \"url\": \"\",\n            \"venueNames\": [\n                \"N/A\"\n            ],\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\n            \"id\": \"8235ef01309d8317e4291b64e48902364488ee39\",\n            \"citations\": 6,\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\n            \"authors\": [\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2069588231\",\n                    \"name\": \"Martina Rapp\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"31365626\",\n                    \"name\": \"Mohammed Bakr Sikal\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\n                    \"name\": \"J.

As a result, we achieve 43% increase in performance while maintaining the same level of circuit aging when compared to the best technique reported yet.\",\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2018-06-01\",\n            \"reference\": null,\n            \"url\": \"\",\n            \"venueNames\": [\n                \"N/A\"\n            ],\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\n            \"id\": \"51699a2a92b4b0f7d26a9c4854700c2df0659a70\",\n            \"citations\": 17,\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\n            \"authors\": [\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\n                    \"name\": \"J.

For instance, Bias Temperature Instability (BTI) leads to an increase in the threshold voltage of a transistor.

In order to avoid aging-induced timing errors, designers employ guardbands either with respect to voltage or frequency. State-of-the-art techniques determine a guardband type at the circuit level at design time irrespective from the running workload at the system level. Our investigation revealed that generated temperatures by a running workload have the potential to play a key role in determining the appropriate guardband type with respect to system performance. Therefore, we propose a paradigm shift in designing guardbands: to select the guardband types on-the-fly with respect to the workload-induced temperatures aiming at optimizing for performance under temperature and reliability constraints. Moreover, different guardband types for different cores can be selected simultaneously when multiple applications with diverse properties suggest this to be useful. Our dynamic guardband selection allows for a higher performance compared to techniques that employ a fixed (at design time) guardband type throughout.\",\n            \"publicationDate\": \"\",\n            \"reference\": null,\n            \"url\": \"\",\n            \"venueNames\": [\n                \"N/A\"\n            ],\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\n            \"id\": \"d368fed35cfc6489dcdc22f15f998faa3320667d\",\n            \"citations\": 0,\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\n            \"authors\": [\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"81650122\",\n                    \"name\": \"Martin Rapp\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2165805657\",\n                    \"name\": \"Nikita Krohmer\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\n                    \"name\": \"J.

However, selecting the core to execute each application and the voltage/frequency (V/f) levels of each cluster is a complex problem because 1) the diverse characteristics and QoS targets of applications require different optimizations, and 2) per-cluster DVFS requires a global optimization considering all running applications. State-of-the-art resource management techniques for power or temperature minimization either rely on measurements that are often not available (such as power) or fail to consider all the dimensions of the problem (e.g., by using simplified analytical models). Imitation learning (IL) enables to use the optimality of an oracle policy, yet at low run-time overhead, by training a model from oracle demonstrations. We are the first to employ IL for temperature minimization under QoS targets. We tackle the complexity by training a neural network (NN) and accelerate the NN inference using a neural processing unit (NPU). While such NN accelerators are becoming increasingly widespread on end devices, they are so far only used to accelerate user applications. In contrast, we use an existing accelerator on a real platform to accelerate NN-based resource management.

Accurately forecasting future power changes is highly relevant for proactive power/thermal management. While forecasting power is straightforward for known or periodic workloads, the challenge for general unknown workloads at different voltage/frequency (v/n-levels is still unsolved. Our technique is based on a long short-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural network (RNN) to forecast the average power consumption for both the next 1ms and 10ms periods. The runtime inputs for the LSTM RNN are current and past power information as well as performance counter readings. An LSTM RNN enables this forecasting due to its ability to preserve the history of power and performance counters. Our LSTM RNN needs to be trained only once at design-time while adapting during run-time to different system behavior through its internal memory. We demonstrate that our approach accurately forecasts power for unseen applications at different v/f-levels. The experimental results shows that the forecasts of our LSTM RNN provide 43% lower worst case error for the 1ms forecasts and 38% for the 10ms forecasts. comnared to the state of the art.\",\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2021-02-01\",\n            \"reference\": null,\n            \"url\": \"\",\n            \"venueNames\": [\n                \"N/A\"\n            ],\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\n            \"id\": \"fd363aabb9b04ccc1279ffbf7f87eee41a3dac37\",\n            \"citations\": 7,\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\n            \"authors\": [\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2144694858\",\n                    \"name\": \"Sepideh Safari\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2022561502\",\n                    \"name\": \"Pourya Gohari-Nazari\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"153631156\",\n                    \"name\": \"Mohsen Ansari\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"1784633\",\n                    \"name\": \"S.

The availability of multiple cores on a single chip provides opportunities to employ fault-tolerant techniques, to ensure the reliability of MCSs. However, applying fault-tolerant techniques increases the power consumption on the chip, and thereby, on-chip temperatures might increase beyond safe limits. To prevent thermal emergencies, urgent countermeasures, like DVFS or DPM will be triggered to cool down the chip. Such countermeasures, however, might not only lead to suspending low-criticality tasks, but also might lead to violating timing constraints of high-criticality tasks. Therefore, it is indispensable to consider a temperature constraint within the scheduling process of fault-tolerant MCSs. Therefore, this paper presents, for the first time, a thermal-aware scheduling scheme for fault-tolerant MCSs, named TherMa-MiCs, which satisfies the temperature constraint jointly with the timing constraints of the high-criticality tasks, while attempting to maximize the QoS of low-criticality tasks under the predefined constraints. At the same time, a reliability target is satisfied by employing the well-known N-Modular Redundancy fault-tolerant technique. Experimental results show that our proposed scheme meets the temperature and timing constraints, while at the same time, improving the QoS of low-criticality tasks, with an average of 44%.\",\n            \"publicationDate\": \"\",\n            \"reference\": null,\n            \"url\": \"\",\n            \"venueNames\": [\n                \"N/A\"\n            ],\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\n            \"id\": \"2124a1c52ce8393b5de4205c74ca555c4eaba90d\",\n            \"citations\": 1,\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\n            \"authors\": [\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"81650122\",\n                    \"name\": \"Martin Rapp\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2165805657\",\n                    \"name\": \"Nikita Krohmer\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"144271439\",\n                    \"name\": \"J.

However, selecting the core to execute each application and the voltage/frequency (V/f) levels of each cluster is a complex problem because 1) the diverse characteristics and QoS targets of applications require different optimizations, and 2) V/f levels are often shared between cores on a cluster, which requires a global optimization considering all running applications. State-of-the-art techniques for power or temperature minimization either rely on measurements that are often not available (such as power) or fail to consider all the dimensions of the problem (e.g., by using simplified analytical models). Imitation learning (IL) enables to use the optimality of an oracle policy, yet at low run-time overhead, by training a model from oracle demonstrations. We are the first to employ IL for temperature minimization under QoS targets. We tackle the complexity by using a neural network (NN) model and accelerate the NN inference using a neural processing unit (NPU). While such NN accelerators are becoming increasingly widespread on end devices, they are so far only used to accelerate user applications. In contrast, we use an accelerator on a real platform to accelerate NN-based resource management. Our evaluation on a HiKey970 board with an Arm big.LITTLE CPU and an NPU shows significant temperature reductions at a negligible overhead while satisfying OoS targets.\",\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2022-03-14\",\n            \"reference\": null,\n            \"url\": \"\",\n            \"venueNames\": [\n                \"N/A\"\n            ],\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\n            \"id\": \"de13984d6fcb9d05beddeca2e3bf6c71806bb555\",\n            \"citations\": 7,\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\n            \"authors\": [\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2144694858\",\n                    \"name\": \"Sepideh Safari\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"153631156\",\n                    \"name\": \"Mohsen Ansari\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2522915\",\n                    \"name\": \"Heba Khdr\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"2022561502\",\n                    \"name\": \"Pourya Gohari-Nazari\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"1820939079\",\n                    \"name\": \"Sina Yari-Karin\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"1411407795\",\n                    \"name\": \"Amir Yeganeh-Khaksar\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"1784633\",\n                    \"name\": \"S.

In particular, technology scaling increases the processor susceptibility to radiation-induced transient faults. Moreover, technology scaling with the discontinuation of Dennard scaling increases the power densities, thereby temperatures, on the chip. High temperature, in turn, accelerates transistor aging mechanisms, which may ultimately lead to permanent faults on the chip. To assure a reliable system operation, despite these potential reliability concerns, fault-tolerance techniques have emerged. Specifically, fault-tolerance techniques employ some kind of redundancies to satisfy specific reliability requirements. However, the integration of fault-tolerance techniques into real-time embedded systems complicates preserving timing constraints. As a remedy, many task mapping/scheduling policies have been proposed to consider the integration of fault-tolerance techniques and enforce both timing and reliability guarantees for real-time embedded systems. More advanced techniques aim additionally at minimizing power and energy while at the same time satisfying timing and reliability constraints. Recently, some scheduling techniques have started to tackle a new challenge, which is the temperature increase induced by employing fault-tolerance techniques. These emerging techniques aim at satisfying temperature constraints besides timing and reliability constraints. This paper provides an in-depth survey of the emerging research efforts that exploit fault-tolerance techniques while considering timing, power/energy, and temperature from the real-time embedded systems’ design perspective. In particular, the task mapping/scheduling policies for fault-tolerance real-time embedded systems are reviewed and classified according to their considered goals and constraints. Moreover, the employed fault-tolerance techniques, application models, and hardware models are considered as additional dimensions of the presented classification.

The cooling solution is designed to dissipate this power level. But because TDP is not necessarily the maximum power that can be applied, chips are operated with Dynamic Thermal Management (DTM) techniques. To avoid excessive triggers of DTM, usually, system designers also use TDP as power constraint. However, using a single and constant value as power constraint, e.g., TDP, can result in big performance losses in many-core systems. Having better power budgeting techniques is a major step towards dealing with the dark silicon problem. This paper presents a new power budget concept, called Thermal Safe Power (TSP), which is an abstraction that provides safe power constraint values as a function of the number of simultaneously operating cores. Executing cores at any power consumption below TSP ensures that DTM is not triggered. TSP can be computed offline for the worst cases, or online for a particular mapping of cores. Our simulations show that using TSP as power constraint results in 50.5% and 14.2% higher average performance, compared to using constant power budgets (both per-chip and per-core) and a boosting technique, respectively. Moreover, TSP results in dark silicon estimations which are more optimistic than estimations using constant power budgets.\",\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2014-10-12\",\n            \"reference\": null,\n            \"url\": \"https://dl.acm.org/doi/pdf/10.1145/2656075.2656103\",\n            \"venueNames\": [\n                \"N/A\"\n            ],\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\n        },\n        {\n            \"type\": \"paper\",\n            \"id\": \"a141c558a7add5ecae33b38003eb34516b95393f\",\n            \"citations\": 17,\n            \"nonSelfAndCoAuthorCitations\": 0,\n            \"authors\": [\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"1970668\",\n                    \"name\": \"Santiago Pagani\"\n                },\n                {\n                    \"authorId\": \"145063983\",\n                    \"name\": \"M.

Hence, a resource management technique, that allocates cores to application aiming at maximizing the system performance, will not be able to achieve its goal without taking into account the on-chip temperature and its impact on the availability of the chip's resources. However, considering a temperature constraint by the resource management will further increase its complexity, especially in manycores, and thus implementing it in a centralized scheme might lead to a computation bottleneck and a single point of failure. To avoid such scenarios, it is inevitable to distribute the computation required by the resource management technique throughout the chip.

Our proposed technique employs, for the first time, combinatorial auctions within an agent system to achieve the targeted goal in a distributed manner.

When deployed in a Quality of Service (QoS)-based system, the many-core must execute a task at a target QoS. The amount of processing required by the task for the QoS varies over the task’s lifetime. Accordingly, Dynamic Voltage and Frequency Scaling (DVFS) allows the many-core to deliver precise amount of processing required to meet the task QoS guarantee while conserving power. Still, a global control is necessitated to ensure that the many-core overall does not exceed its power budget.Previously, only non-stochastic controls have been proposed for the problem of QoS-aware power budgeting in many-cores. We propose the first stochastic control for the problem, which has a computational complexity less than the non-stochastic control by a factor of O (ln n) but with equivalent performance. The proposed stochastic control can operate with 6.4× less overhead than the non-stochastic control for a 256-task workload.\",\n            \"publicationDate\": \"2018-06-01\",\n            \"reference\": null,\n            \"url\": \"\",\n            \"venueNames\": [\n                \"N/A\"\n            ],\n            \"venueType\": \"N/A\",\n            \"issn\": \"N/A\"\n        }\n    ]\n}"
