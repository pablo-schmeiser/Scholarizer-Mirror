counter.py is used to count the lines of code in the root directory of Scholarizer.
It counts all lines of code in the "src/main", "reactapp", "reactapp v2" folders, excluding package files etc.

To run, simply type
	
	"python counter.py"	on Windows
	"python3 counter.py"	on Linux and Mac

into your terminal.

(Of course, python 3 has to be installed, you can check that it is by typing "python -V" into your terminal (it has to be a capital V !!!))
